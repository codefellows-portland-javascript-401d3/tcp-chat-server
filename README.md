## Simple TCP Server Example

• run following command in terminal `node server.js`

• then open browser and navigate to `localhost:65000`

• open a new terminal window and run `telnet localhost 65000` to create a new chat user, do this with at least two windows

• feel free to chat amongst your "users"

• when you're ready to disconnect a user run `ctrl + ]` and then `ctrl + c` to exit telnet and the node environment
